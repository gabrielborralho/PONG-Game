A .hex file is generated while compiling the code in the Arduino IDE. To do this, you must select the following option in the Arduino IDE

File -> Preferences -> Mark the toolbox "compilation"

When compiling the code, a pach will appear in the Arduino IDE error log.

To record the microcontroller, the USB-ASP recorder with the ProgISP software was used.

The following components were used:

> Gabriel Borralho Board ATMega328P;

> ATMEL Recorder AVR USBasp;

> Protoboard;

> Adjustable Source for Protoboard;

> Pack of Jumpers;

> Buzzer module;

> DIP Switch 4 way;

> 9V battery;

> Pong board

> Touch Key 4 Terminals;
